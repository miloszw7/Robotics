Robotics

For this project we was given sensors and a turtlebot robot and had to design a useful robot.

Our idea for this was a security dog that would travel between strategic points (windows/doors) and also detect loud noises simulating a break in. When an intruder was detected through motion it would send a message and set off an alarm.
