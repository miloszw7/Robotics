Robotics

For this project we was given hardware and a turtlebot robot, our task was to design a robot useful to society.

Our idea for this was a security robot dog that would travel between strategic points (windows/doors) and also detect loud noises simulating a break in. When an intruder was detected through motion it would send a message and set off an alarm.
